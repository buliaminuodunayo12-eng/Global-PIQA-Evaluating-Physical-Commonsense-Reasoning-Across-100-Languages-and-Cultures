# Global-PIQA-Evaluating-Physical-Commonsense-Reasoning-Across-100-Languages-and-Cultures
ABOUT GLOBAL PIQA
Global PIQA is a large, community-built benchmark designed to evaluate physical and cultural commonsense reasoning across 100 language and cultures.
The project involved 335+ researchers from 65 countries, all contributing culturally specific questions and answers in their native languages.

🇳🇬 MY CONTRIBUTION: NIGERIAN PIDGIN DATASET
I contributed a manually created dataset of physical commonsense reasoning questions written in Nigerian Pidgin (Naijá).

WHAT I DID:
1. Designed culturally grounded commonsense scenarios based on everyday Nigerian life.
2. Created PIQA-style questions involving Nigerian household items, food, clothing, norms, and daily activities.
3. Ensured questions reflect real-life reasoning familiar to Nigerian Pidgin speakers.
4. Validated and refined examples for clarity and cultural accuracy.

WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT:
Nigerian Pidgin is a widely spoken but under-resourced language.
Including it in Global PIQA:
1. Increases representation of West African languages
2. Improves multilingual evaluation fairness
3. Helps LLMs better understand culturally grounded reasoning in Naijá.
